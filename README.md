## Workshop description

Email is reliable, global, and offers flexibility that can't be met by other communications channels.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to implement the Twilio SendGrid Email API, and you can expect some deliverability tips to help you start sending at scale. What kind of scale? In 2022, SendGrid sent more than 1.6 trillion messages â€” 50 billion of which were sent during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday week alone while maintaining a 99 percent delivery rate.

You'll also see how the SendGrid dynamic templating system makes it possible to personalize your messages for each customer, allowing you to build lasting connections with your audience.
